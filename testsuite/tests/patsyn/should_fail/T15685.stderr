    • Could not deduce: k ~ [k0]
      from the context: as ~ (a : as1)
        bound by a pattern with constructor:

      ‘k’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of HereNil :: NS f as
        at T15685.hs:13:9-15
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘HereNil’
    • In the pattern: Nil
      In the pattern: Here Nil
      In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘HereNil’
