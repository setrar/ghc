    • Illegal term-level use of the type constructor ‘Foo’
        imported from ‘Mod132_B’ at mod132.hs:4:1-15
        (and originally defined in ‘Mod132_A’ at Mod132_A.hs:3:1-14)
      Perhaps you meant variable ‘foo’ (line 6)
    • In the expression: Foo
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = Foo
