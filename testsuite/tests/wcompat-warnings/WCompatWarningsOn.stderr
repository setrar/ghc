Template.hs:7:1: warning: [-Wsemigroup (in -Wcompat)]
    Local definition of ‘<>’ clashes with a future Prelude name.
    This will become an error in a future release.

Template.hs:13:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances (in -Wdefault, -Wcompat)]
    Noncanonical ‘(<>) = mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Semigroup S’.
    Move definition from ‘mappend’ to ‘(<>)’

Template.hs:16:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances (in -Wdefault, -Wcompat)]
    Noncanonical ‘mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monoid S’.
    ‘mappend’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘(<>)’
    Either remove definition for ‘mappend’ (recommended) or define as ‘mappend = (<>)’

Template.hs:20:15: warning: [-Wstar-is-type (in -Wall, -Wcompat)]
    Using ‘*’ (or its Unicode variant) to mean ‘Data.Kind.Type’
    relies on the StarIsType extension, which will become
    deprecated in the future.
    Suggested fix: Use ‘Type’ from ‘Data.Kind’ instead.
