T13785.hs:16:5: warning: [-Wmonomorphism-restriction]
    • The Monomorphism Restriction applies to the bindings
      for ‘bar2’, ‘baz2’
    • In an equation for ‘foo’:
          foo
            = bar >> baz >> bar2
            where
                bar, baz :: m Char
                (bar, baz) = c
                (bar2, baz2) = c
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘baz2’ and ‘bar2’ a type signature
